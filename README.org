#+TITLE: rust "Hello, world!" application
#+AUTHOR: Philippe Crama

* Introduction

Minimal web application to learn rust (web application) programming and
experiment with ChatGPT (sometimes via https://phind.com).
I started with the following prompt:

#+begin_quote
  Teach me how to code in Rust by providing step-by-step instructions
  to deploy a rust hello-world web application deployed behind lighttpd
  alongside an existing pi.hole installation on a raspberry pi 2.
#+end_quote

* Installation

1. Add the [[file:./doc/20-rust-hello-world.conf][20-rust-hello-world.conf]] file to the
   =/etc/lighttpd/conf-available/= directory and create a symlink to enable it:
   #+begin_src shell :exports code
     cd /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled
     sudo ln -s ../conf-available/20-rust-hello-world.conf
   #+end_src

2. Enable =mod_proxy= for lighttpd.

3. Put [[file:doc/rust-hello-world.service][rust-hello-world.service]] into the =/etc/systemd/system/= directory.

4. (Re)start the services
   #+begin_src shell :exports code
     sudo systemctl restart rust-hello-world
     sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
   #+end_src
